# Instructions  

This task is open ended, you guys have to create some sort of game that can be played in the command line, using everything you've learned in Python so far. You can do whatever you want, but here are some suggestions (in order of increasing difficulty):

- Text adventure game
- Scissors paper stone
- Anagram/number guessing game
- Tic tac toe
- Hangman/wordle
- Connect four
- Minesweeper

Once you're done, make a simple 5 minute presentation on how your game works and the different Python concepts you used, to present in class next lesson.

Like last time, message me on Teams if you run into any technical issues or join the wrong group. Have fun!
